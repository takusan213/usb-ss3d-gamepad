* PreCondition: button configured via BUTTON_SetConfiguration()
*
* Input: BUTTON button - enumeration of the buttons available in
*        this demo.  They should be meaningful names and not the names 
*        of the buttons on the silkscreen on the board (as the demo

* Output: TRUE if pressed; FALSE if not pressed.
